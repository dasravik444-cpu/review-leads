"""E-mail hunt: a second, deeper look for every lead that still has no usable e-mail.

0. Other listings of the same business in the open data (same phone number, similar name) - one is often
   the Facebook page without an e-mail, another the business's own listing with one, or with its website.
1. Its own website again, deeper: privacy/terms pages and the sitemap's contact pages, over http/https and
   with/without www when it did not answer, robots.txt read with a browser-like client when the plain one
   failed. Addresses written as text count when they carry the site's domain or the business's name.
2. No website on its listing (or a dead/taken-over one): the obvious addresses for its name are checked,
   and a site is accepted only when it shows the business's own phone number (or exact name + PIN code).
   Then that site is read like step 1.

Every e-mail kept comes from a page of the business's own site, with that page as its source. Nothing is
guessed. Network work runs in threads; the database is only touched by the main thread."""
