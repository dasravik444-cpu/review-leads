"""WhatsApp send queue (free, within WhatsApp's rules).

WhatsApp gives no free sending API: the only official API (the WhatsApp Business Platform) charges per
message, and automating the WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business app breaks WhatsApp's terms and gets numbers
banned. So the system prepares a short daily queue of personalised messages as wa.me links: tapping a
link opens the chat in WhatsApp Business on the owner's phone with the message already typed, and the
owner presses send. Numbers that are not on WhatsApp are simply marked and never queued again.
